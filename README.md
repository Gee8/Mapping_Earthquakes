# Mapping_Earthquakes
For our Mapping_Earthquakes, we have used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a world map to display tectonic plates and earthquakes for the last seven days. To display the map, we used the mapbox api, and different styles to create street, satellite, and dark layers. We created three overlays: Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes. Using GeoJSON files and D3, we mapped the earthquakes for the last seven days with size and color based on the magnitude of the earthquake. Similarly, we mapped the major earthquakes as the earthquakes for the last seven days that had magnitudes of 4.5+. To map the tectonic plates, we used another GeoJSON file to map the multiple linestrings to show the tectonic plates on the map. We created the legend within our js and css files to display the colors associated with the magnitudes. Shown below is each of our layers for our map and the layout options to choose from.
